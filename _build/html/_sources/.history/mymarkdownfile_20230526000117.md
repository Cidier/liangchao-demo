<!-- (section-label)= is a label that’s attached to a section header. It refers to whatever header follows, and allows you to refer to this label later on in your text.

[link text](link-target) syntax is how you specify a link in markdown. Here we’ve linked to another page, as well as to the label we created above. -->
